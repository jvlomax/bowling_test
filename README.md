# Bowling game test
A simple tech test to create a class that can keep track of a bowling game.

## Requirements
To run the tests, you will have to install unittest2. 
This can be done by installing from the requirements file
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running
This programme doesn't run, it just tests.

## Testing
Run the `test_bowling.py` script in the python version of your choice:

`python -m unittest test_bowling.py`

or use a test runner like pytest

`pytest test_bowling.py`

If all tests pass, you have success. If not, adjust flux capacitors and try again.
