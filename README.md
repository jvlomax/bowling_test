# Bowling game test
A simple tech test to create a class that can keep track of a bowling game.

## Running
This programme doesn't run, it just tests.

## Testing
Run the `test_bowling.py` script in the python version of your choice:

`python test_bowling.py`

If all tests pass, you have success. If not, adjust flux capacitors and try again.
